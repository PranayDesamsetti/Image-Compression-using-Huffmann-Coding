# Image-Compression-using-Huffmann-Coding

## Overview
This repository contains MATLAB code for image compression using Huffman Coding. Huffman coding is a widely used technique for lossless data compression. In this project, we implement Huffman coding to compress and decompress images efficiently.

### What is Huffman Coding?
Huffman coding is a variable-length prefix coding algorithm used for data compression. It assigns shorter codes to more frequent symbols and longer codes to less frequent symbols, resulting in efficient data compression. In image compression, it helps reduce the file size while preserving image quality.

## Features
- Image compression using Huffman Coding.
- Decoding of compressed images to reconstruct the original images.
- MATLAB scripts for compression and decompression.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open MATLAB and navigate to the project directory.

### Image Compression
3. Run the `compress_image.m` script to compress an image.
   - Input: Provide the path to the image you want to compress.
   - Output: Compressed image file will be generated.

### Image Decompression
4. Run the `decompress_image.m` script to decompress the compressed image.
   - Input: Provide the path to the compressed image file.
   - Output: Decompressed image file will be generated.
