# Image-Compression-using-Huffmann-Coding

## Overview
This repository contains MATLAB code for image compression using Huffman Coding. Huffman coding is a widely used technique for lossless data compression. In this project, we implement Huffman coding to compress images efficiently and display the compression efficiency.

### What is Huffman Coding?
Huffman coding is a variable-length prefix coding algorithm used for data compression. It assigns shorter codes to more frequent symbols and longer codes to less frequent symbols, resulting in efficient data compression. In image compression, it helps reduce the file size while preserving image quality.

## Features
- Image compression using Huffman Coding.
- MATLAB script for compression (named `Image Compression.m`).
- Display of compression efficiency.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open MATLAB and navigate to the project directory.

### Image Compression
3. Run the `Image Compression.m` script to compress an image.
   - Input: Provide the path to the image you want to compress.
   - Output: The script will compress the image and display the compression efficiency.

## Dependencies
This project relies on MATLAB for image processing and utilizes built-in Huffman coding functions `huffmanenco()` and `huffmandeco()` for compression.
